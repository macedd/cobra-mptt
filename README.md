#MPTT (Modified Preorder Tree Traversal) class for PDO


Tired of looking for a decent PHP Mptt implementation? Just found. Cobra MPTT is a port of a great work from the Kohana people.

Many improvements on performance and reliability has been done. Check the example and tests for usage.

It also ships a simple *database interface* which allows you to create **your own** database layer.

Enjoy!
