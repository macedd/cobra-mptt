#MPTT (Modified Preorder Tree Traversal) class for PDO

Preambule: MPTT is an eficient hierarchical tree algorithm also known as `Nested Sets`.

Tired of looking for a stand-alone PHP Mptt implementation? Just found.
Cobra MPTT is a port of the work from the Kohana people.

Many improvements on performance and reliability has been done. Check the example and tests for usage.

It also ships a simple a *database interface* which allows you to create **your own** database layer. This means you can, in a simply manner, use the class with the database/class of your linking.

Enjoy!
